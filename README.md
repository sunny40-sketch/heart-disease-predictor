## Live Demo
[Click here to try the app](https://heart-disease-predictor-tkmskyk9sqqlvas7yzphom.streamlit.app/)

## Results
- **Recall:** 0.915
- **Std:** 0.023
- **Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Validation:** Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation (5 folds)

## Business Context
Missing a high-risk patient (False Negative) is more costly than a false alarm.
Model is optimized for recall to minimize missed cases.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Joblib

## How to Run Locally
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
